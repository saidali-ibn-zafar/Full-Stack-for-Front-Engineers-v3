 The general syntax for using OpenSSL to compute hash values from the command line is:

 ```bash
openssl <NameOfFunction> <fileName>

```

There are numerous hashing functions used in computer science and cryptography, each with its own characteristics and applications. Some common hashing functions include:

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)

SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)

Blake2

Whirlpool

RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest)

These are just a few examples, and there are many more hashing functions with varying properties and applications. The choice of hashing function depends on factors such as security requirements, performance considerations, and compatibility with existing systems.
